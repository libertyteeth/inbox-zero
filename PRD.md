# Product Requirements Document: IMAP Integration

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for adding IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) support to the application. This feature will focus on self-hosted IMAP setups, providing a complete privacy-oriented solution. The goal is to create a powerful, open-source tool that empowers users to manage their email with a focus on privacy and control.

## 2. Guiding Principles

*   **Privacy First:** All decisions will be made with user privacy as the top priority. We will collect the minimum amount of data necessary and be transparent about what we collect.
*   **Open Source:** The project will be open source, allowing for community contributions and transparency.
*   **Self-Hosted Focus:** The primary target for this feature is users with their own self-hosted email servers.

## 3. Goals

*   Allow users to connect their self-hosted IMAP accounts.
*   Fetch, read, and display emails from IMAP accounts in a secure and private manner.
*   Provide a robust and reliable connection to IMAP servers.
*   Maintain a consistent and intuitive user experience.

## 4. User Stories

*   As a user with a self-hosted email server, I want to be able to connect my email account by providing my email address, password, and IMAP/SMTP server details.
*   As a user, I want to be confident that my credentials and email data are stored securely and privately.
*   As a user, I want to see all my emails from my IMAP account in the application.
*   As a user, I want to be able to read and send emails from my IMAP account.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1. Backend

*   **IMAP Library:** We will use the `imapflow` library to interact with IMAP servers. It is a modern, promise-based library that is well-maintained and has good documentation.
*   **Authentication:** The application will need to store IMAP credentials (username, password, server host, and port) securely. These credentials will be encrypted in the database.
*   **Email Fetching:** The application will fetch emails from the user's IMAP account and store them in our database. This will involve connecting to the IMAP server, selecting the appropriate mailbox (e.g., "INBOX"), and fetching the email data.
*   **Email Sending:** We will use `nodemailer` with the IMAP account's SMTP settings to send emails.
*   **New API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /api/imap/connect`: To add a new IMAP account. This endpoint will take the user's IMAP credentials, test the connection, and if successful, save the credentials to the database.
    *   `GET /api/imap/emails`: To fetch emails from the IMAP account.
    *   `POST /api/imap/send`: To send an email from the IMAP account.

### 5.2. Frontend

*   **New UI for IMAP:** A new section in the "Accounts" page will be created to allow users to add a self-hosted IMAP account. This will include a form for the user to enter their email address, password, and IMAP/SMTP server details.
*   **Displaying IMAP Emails:** Emails from IMAP accounts will be displayed in the same way as Gmail emails, providing a consistent user experience.

## 6. Implementation Plan

1.  **Backend:**
    1.  Add `imapflow` and `nodemailer` to the `package.json` of the `apps/mcp-server` application.
    2.  Update the database schema to include a new table for IMAP accounts, including encrypted credentials.
    3.  Create a new module `apps/web/utils/imap` to encapsulate all IMAP-related functionality.
    4.  Implement the `POST /api/imap/connect` endpoint.
    5.  Implement the `GET /api/imap/emails` endpoint.
    6.  Implement the `POST /api/imap/send` endpoint.
2.  **Frontend:**
    1.  Create a new component for the IMAP account connection form.
    2.  Integrate the new component into the "Accounts" page.
    3.  Update the email display components to handle emails from IMAP accounts.

## 7. Security and Privacy

*   All IMAP credentials will be encrypted at rest in the database.
*   All communication with the IMAP server will be over a secure (TLS) connection.
*   We will not log any sensitive user information, such as passwords or email content.
*   The application will be designed to run entirely on a user's own infrastructure, ensuring they have full control over their data.

## 8. Risks and Mitigations

*   **Risk:** Supporting a wide variety of self-hosted IMAP server configurations can be challenging.
*   **Mitigation:** We will provide clear documentation and configuration examples for popular self-hosted email solutions. We will also foster a community forum where users can help each other with configuration issues.
*   **Risk:** Storing user passwords is a security risk.
*   **Mitigation:** We will use strong encryption for all stored credentials and follow security best practices to protect our database. We will also encourage users to use app-specific passwords where possible.
